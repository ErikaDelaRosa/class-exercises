![paella](/images/paella.jpeg)

The **ingredients** we need are:

* Arborio rice
* Saffron
* Fish cube or fish stoke - we can made this. 
* Seafood you like, as for example:
    * Mussels
    * Clams
    * Squid
    * Prawns
    * Crayfish
* For the sofrito:
    * Onion
    * Garlic
    * Chopped tomato
    * Olive oil
    

**Steps**: 

1. We will start with the "sofrito". We will add some extra virgin olive oil to our _paellera_ and fried the chopped onion, garlic, and tomatoes, this will make the base of our paella.

2. Now is the time to add the seafood with shell (like mussels for example) the steam will help to open them. Just make sure you clean them carefully. 

3. We add the rice, the saffron and the fish stock (always duble quantity of liquid vs rice -  for example, one cup of rice and two cups of water).

4. We add the rest of the seafood, and we wait 20 min until the rice is done. 

> Important! Once we have added the rice we move it once, and do not touch it until is done! 

5. Once is done, apart the paella from the fire and leave it rest for 5-10 min covered by a clean cloth. 

> To be sure that our rice will be coocked perfectly, make sure the size of the _paellera_ and the fire match. 

6. You can serve it with a little bit of lemon squiz on top, and is higly recommended to paring it with a good white wine or cava.
